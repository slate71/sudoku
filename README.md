## Gulp
Decided to use Gulp as the build system mainly because I hadn't used it before. I've been entrenched in Grunt and saw this as a good opportunity to see what all the noise was about. At first blush, I find the differences negligible (for a small project) but do enjoy the "code over configuration" style of Gulp. The streaming is cool, too.  However if I had more time, I'd try foregoing both and using NPM exclusively before coming to a final conclusion. Plus, I imagine there's more to come in the world of build tools. For now, this tool is set up, it works, let's press on!
